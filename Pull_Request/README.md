# Project Title

import the turtlelab

## Getting Started

You will need to set andy and lance initial distance to 0.  Use the variables andyTotalDistance and lanceTotalDistance.

When you have modified the file, zip it and save it to a location you can find.  Then go ahead and submit your zipped file here.
import the turtle module
import random
import the random module
reate a screen
label the screen

lance = turtle.Turtle()     #create two turtles
andy = turtle.Turtle()      #create two turtles

### Prerequisites
You need to use the following comments in the appropriate location, you can add additional comments.

Make a random distance for andy to move
Use a cascading set of conditions to determine the winner.
Make a random distance for lance to move
Import the turtle module 
Imort the random module
create a third turtle object called start that will be used to display the winner of the game 
use a cascading set of if conditions to determine the winner.
#use a cascading set of if conditions to determine the winner below. 


## Running
Oiterate through the loop to run the forward method on both turtles 150 times
this section is to determine the winner of the game and be used to print who the winner is.  It calculates total distance for lance and for andy.
Add any additional ways to run the program below
use a cascading set of if conditions to determine the winner below. 

```
python demo.py
```

python demo.py test.txt
```
